# API Wiser Showcases

## Redocly Museum API with API Wiser

The [Redocly Museum API showcase](api-wiser-museum.md) demonstrates how to use [API Wiser](https://github.com/org-metalib/api-wiser) to generate a modular Java project from an OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification.  
It uses the [Redocly Museum API](https://redocly.com/demo/openapi/museum-api) as a real-world example, illustrating the process of generating models, API interfaces, business logic, and client/server implementations.  
This showcase provides a step-by-step guide to generating, building, and running a complete API project using Maven and API Wiser, highlighting best practices for clean architecture and modular design.
